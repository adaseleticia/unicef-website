   <p>Around 180,000 children under 5 years old die every year – roughly 500 a day – in sub-Saharan Africa due to
      diarrhoeal
      diseases linked to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), UNICEF said ahead of a conference in Dakar on
      financing for the sector.
   
      “With children dying every single day, with millions stunted, with such a huge economic toll, it cannot be business
      as
      usual,” said UNICEF Regional Director for West & Central Africa Manuel Fontaine. “The pace of progress has to speed
      up
      exponentially – and it’s going to take strong policies; robust financing; and a major shift in priorities among those
      who have the power to act.”</p><img class="top2"> </div>

   <h2 id="about"> Action </h2>
    <div> <p>  <br> UNICEF said that without speedy action, the situation can drastically worsen
      within the next 20 years, as rapidly rising
      populations outstrip the efforts of governments to provide essential services. For example, the number of people in
      the region who defecate in the open is higher now than it was in 1990. Meanwhile, open defecation has been linked to an increase in stunting among children.We dont want to spend huge amount of Money for expensive drugs and hospital bills. We are fighting  for hygine and the fight starts now!!! </p>
